    <h1>Code of Hammurabi: Was it Just?</h1>
    <h2>(DBQ: Document-Based Question)</h2>

        <h3>After reading the 5 documents and answering the questions connected to each document, find evidence for both sides of the argument and put it into the boxes below. (Make sure that you have selected evidence from all the documents to cover family law, personal injury law, and property law). You should have at least 3-4 pieces of evidence on each side MINIMUM but try for more.</h3>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>The Code of Hammurabi was JUST because…</h2>
        <p class="indent">The code was just because one of the laws says that if a free man has knocked out the eye of a free man, then his eye shall be knocked out, too. This is fair because if a free man did it to another free man, then it wouldn't be equal, but they are both free men. So if both of their eyes were knocked out, then it would be fair for both of them.</p>
        <p class="indent">Another fair law is if a man strikes the daughter of a free man and causes her to lose the fruit of her womb, the man shall pay 10 shekels of silver. This is fair because if you caused harm to the daughter of a free man, then he shall have a punishment, which is 10 shekels of silver. That is an equal law for both of the free men.</p>
        <p class="indent">And if a man has flooded his neighbor's field, then he has to repair what he has done. This is a fair law because the field is flooded, so he should do the repairs, meaning that he would fix the thing he did wrong.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>The Code of Hammurabi was NOT JUST because…</h2>
        <p class="indent">The code was not just because, for example, one of the laws says that if two people are caught being a couple, the law is that they will be tied up and thrown into the water. This law is unfair because if there are no couples, fewer people will be born, making the people miserable.</p>
        <p class="indent">Another law is if a person breaks into a house creating a hole, then when he is caught, he will face the penalties of either immediate death or he will be hanged in the hole he made. This penalty has gone too far; it should be just like spending a long time in jail or something like that.</p>
        <p class="indent">Also, another law says that when a surgeon operates with a bronze lancet on a free man for a serious injury and has caused his death, the surgeon's hands will be cut off. This isn't fair because if the man dies, it is not the surgeon's fault that the man died. It should not be this way; the surgeon should not receive any punishment for a man that requires special treatment.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>Thesis Statement</h2>
        <p class="thesis">The laws in the Code of Hammurabi are super old and really unfair. They say if people are in love, they get thrown into the water, which is really mean because people should be able to love each other. Doctors can lose their hands if a patient dies, even if the doctor is trying to help. And if someone breaks into a house, they might be killed. These laws are way too harsh, and we need nicer rules that help people instead of hurting them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>Selected Evidence</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If a person breaks into a house creating a hole, then when he is caught, he will face the penalties of either immediate death or he will be hanged in the hole he made. This is unfair because the crook will be hanged, which is removing a person from the kingdom. The crook should go to jail, instead of being hanged in the hole. This means that the punishment should be different from the original punishment.</li>
