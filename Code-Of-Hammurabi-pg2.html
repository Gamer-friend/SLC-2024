    <h1>Code of Hammurabi: Was it Just? (PG 2/2)</h1>
    <h2>(DBQ: Document-Based Question)</h2>


    <div class="box">
        <h2>CER Paragraph</h2>
        <p class="indent">The Code of Hammurabi was super unfair because of its harsh punishments, which didn't treat people equally and didn't think about how complicated people can be. One of the laws said that if two people were caught loving each other, they would be tied up and thrown into the water. This is so unfair because it doesn't let people choose who they want to love. It's like punishing someone for something they can't control! One of the laws said that if someone broke into a house by making a hole, they could be killed or hanged in the hole they made. This punishment is way too harsh and doesn't think about why the person did it. What if they were starving and needed food? Should they still be killed? The law about surgeons is unfair because it punishes them for something that might not be their fault. This is like punishing a teacher for a student's bad grade, even if the teacher did everything right! These laws make people scared, angry, and unhappy, and they don't help people become better citizens. We need laws that are fair, and kind, and help people, not hurt them. These laws show that the Code of Hammurabi was unfair and didn't consider how complicated people can be. The law about loving each other is unfair because it doesn't allow people to choose who they want to love. It's like taking away someone's happiness just because of who they love! The law about breaking into a house is also unfair because it's too harsh. Instead of killing them, they should spend a long time in jail to think about what they did and make it right. But if a surgeon's patient died during surgery, the surgeon's hands would be cut off. This is so unfair because the surgeon might not be entirely to blame. Surgery is already really hard and risky, and punishing a surgeon for something that might not be their fault is mean and unfair.</p>

        <h2>Peer Review</h2>
        <p>If you have a thesis statement and at least 3-5 pieces of supporting evidence that you can elaborate on, you are ready to write your CER paragraph. Have a peer check to help see if you are ready, and have them sign their name here if they agree that you are ready to proceed: Isaya.</p>

        <p>I think that my work is a 4 because I worked on this hard, and I also used my detailed notes to help me write this CER.</p>
